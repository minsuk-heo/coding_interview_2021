"""
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has a size equal to m + n such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from nums2.

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]

Initialize nums1Copy to be a new array containing the first m values of nums1.
Initialize read pointer p1 to the beginning of nums1Copy.
Initialize read pointer p2 to the beginning of nums2.
Initialize write pointer p to the beginning of nums1.
While p is still within nums1:
If nums1Copy[p1] exists and is less than or equal to nums2[p2]:
Write nums1Copy[p1] into nums1[p], and increment p1 by 1.
Else
Write nums2[p2] into nums1[p], and increment p2 by 1.
Increment p by 1.
