"""
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

Intuition

Two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts (respective number of occurrences of each character) are the same.

Algorithm

We can transform each string \text{s}s into a character count, \text{count}count, consisting of 26 non-negative integers representing the number of \text{a}a's, \text{b}b's, \text{c}c's, etc. We use these counts as the basis for our hash map.

In Java, the hashable representation of our count will be a string delimited with '#' characters. For example, abbccc will be #1#2#3#0#0#0...#0 where there are 26 entries total. In python, the representation will be a tuple of the counts. For example, abbccc will be (1, 2, 3, 0, 0, ..., 0), where again there are 26 entries total.
