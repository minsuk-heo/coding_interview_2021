"""
Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s which will contain all the characters in t. If there is no such window in s that covers all characters in t, return the empty string "".

Note that If there is such a window, it is guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in s.

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"

We start with two pointers, leftleft and rightright initially pointing to the first element of the string SS.

We use the rightright pointer to expand the window until we get a desirable window i.e. a window that contains all of the characters of TT.

Once we have a window with all the characters, we can move the left pointer ahead one by one. If the window is still a desirable one we keep on updating the minimum window size.

If the window is not desirable any more, we repeat step \; 2step2 onwards.
